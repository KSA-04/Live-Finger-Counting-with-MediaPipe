Accurate finger counting for both left and right hands
Total fingers displayed live on screen
Individual finger count shown near each hand
Works with one or two hands simultaneously
Smooth and responsive visualization

📂 OUTPUT:
The number of fingers detected is displayed:
  Near each hand (Left / Right)
  As a total count at the top-left corner of the window
